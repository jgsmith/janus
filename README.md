# Mensendi

![master build status](https://travis-ci.org/jgsmith/mensendi.svg?branch=master)

Mensendi is a project with which I'm learning Elixir. It's also a combination HL7 integration
engine and protected health information vault. For now, it's focused on capturing the HL7v2.5
message structures and the ability to parse messages into useful data structures.
