### About Mensendi

Mensendi is an HL7 integration engine designed to run in the cloud. Rather than seeing 100% uptime as the
gold standard of resilient systems, it aims for 0% data loss in the face of unreliable infrastructure, be
it the data transport over the network or the instances on which it is running.

### Using Mensendi

Mensendi is in the early stages of development. Immediate goals include an absolute minimum proof of
concept that can ingest HL7 messages and forward them to another system.

### Contributing to Mensendi

The easiest way to contribute to Mensendi is fork the github repository and create a pull request once
you have implemented and tested your changes.
